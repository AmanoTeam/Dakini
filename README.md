# netbsd-gcc-cross

This is a GCC cross-compiler targeting NetBSD. It uses the patchset from NetBSD’s [pkgsrc](https://github.com/NetBSD/pkgsrc/tree/trunk/lang/gcc15) repository, rebased on top of the latest Binutils and GCC.

## Releases

The current release is based on GCC 15 and supports cross-compiling for the `x86`, `x86_64`, and `aarch64` targets. The toolchain includes support for the C and C++ frontends.

You can download the prebuilt toolchains from the [releases](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/Dakini/releases) page.
